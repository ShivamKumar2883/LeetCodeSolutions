Welcome to my GitHub repository! This collection showcases my solutions to LeetCode problems, primarily focusing on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and Competitive Programming (CP), implemented in C++. This repository is designed to track my progress, provide a reference for others, and facilitate collaborative learning.

Contents:

Data Structures:

Arrays & Strings: Basic and advanced manipulations, searching, sorting, and more.
Linked Lists: Single, double, and circular linked lists operations.
Stacks & Queues: Implementation and problem-solving using LIFO and FIFO principles.
Trees & Graphs: Binary trees, BSTs, AVL trees, graph traversals, and shortest path algorithms.
Hash Tables: Hashing techniques, collision handling, and efficient lookups.

Algorithms:

Sorting & Searching: Implementations of quicksort, mergesort, binary search, and more.
Dynamic Programming: Solutions involving memoization and bottom-up approaches for optimization problems.
Greedy Algorithms: Problems solved using locally optimal choices.
Backtracking: Techniques for solving constraint satisfaction problems.
Divide and Conquer: Recursive problem-solving approaches.

Competitive Programming:

Optimization Problems: Efficient solutions focusing on time and space complexity.
Advanced Topics: String algorithms, bit manipulation, combinatorics, and mathematical problems.

Features:

Well-Documented Code: Each solution includes comments and explanations to aid understanding.
Problem Descriptions: Each file contains a brief description of the problem and a link to the original LeetCode problem statement.
Organized Structure: Solutions are neatly organized into directories based on topic and difficulty level.
